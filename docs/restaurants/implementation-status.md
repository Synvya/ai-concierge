### Development Infrastructure
- **Automated Testing**

  - One kind 31989 with `d:"9901"` (recommendation for reservation.request)
  - One kind 31989 with `d:"9902"` (recommendation for reservation.response)

## 🔧 Partially Implemented

### NIP-13 Proof of Work
- ✅ Library implemented with full mining logic
- ✅ Difficulty calculation and validation
- ✅ Test coverage
- ❌ **Not enforced on outgoing messages**
- ❌ **Not validated on incoming messages**
- 📍 Located: `client/src/lib/nip13.ts`
- 📅 **Will be enforced in Phase 2**

## 📅 Planned (Phase 2 - Calendar Integration)

### NIP-40 Expiration Timestamps
- Auto-expire old reservation proposals
- Time-bound holds
- Cleanup of expired threads

### NIP-52 Calendar Events
- **Kind 31923**: Time-Based Calendar Event
  - Sent by restaurant after confirmation
  - Wrapped via NIP-59
  - Contains finalized booking details

- **Kind 31924**: Calendar Definition
  - Store confirmed reservations
  - Both restaurant and user calendars
  - Addressable/replaceable events

- **Kind 31925**: RSVP
  - Sent by AI Concierge to confirm receipt
  - Completes the reservation loop

### Complete Reservation Flow
1. AI Concierge → Restaurant: Request (9901)
2. Restaurant → Concierge: Modification request (9903) if time unavailable, or Response (9902) if confirmed/declined
3. If modification requested: Customer → Restaurant: Modification response (9904) - accept or decline
4. Restaurant → Concierge: Response (9902) - confirmed or declined based on modification response
5. Restaurant → Concierge: Calendar event (31923) - after confirmation
6. Concierge → Restaurant: RSVP (31925)
7. Both parties: Store in calendar (31924)
