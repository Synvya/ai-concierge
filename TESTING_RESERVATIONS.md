# Testing Reservation Notifications - Manual Test Guide

## Prerequisites

1. **Backend running**: `cd backend && source .venv/bin/activate && uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`
2. **Frontend running**: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. **Browser**: Open `http://localhost:5173`

## Test Scenario 1: Send a Reservation Request

### Steps:
1. Open the chat interface at `http://localhost:5173`
2. Type: `"Book a table for 2 at Smoothies & Muffins tomorrow at 3pm"`
3. Press Send

### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ Backend detects restaurant supports reservations (NIP-89 discovery)
- ‚úÖ OpenAI calls `send_reservation_request` function
- ‚úÖ Frontend shows: "Reservation request sent to Smoothies & Muffins"
- ‚úÖ Green success toast appears
- ‚úÖ No errors in console

### Check Backend Logs:
```bash
tail -f /tmp/backend-new.log | grep -i "reservation\|nip89"
```

You should see:
- NIP-89 handler discovery for the restaurant's public key
- `supports_reservations: True` in the business context
- OpenAI function call to `send_reservation_request`
- Nostr gift wrap event published to relays

### Check Frontend Console:
- "Reservation request sent successfully"
- No "Buffer is not defined" errors
- No CORS errors
- No authentication errors

## Test Scenario 2: Receive a Reservation Response (Simulated)

### Background:
When a restaurant responds to your reservation via Nostr (kind 32102 event), the frontend subscription automatically detects it and shows notifications.

### Notification Types You Should See:

#### 1. **Confirmed Reservation** ‚úÖ
- **Toast**: Green success toast at top
- **Title**: "‚úÖ Reservation Confirmed!"
- **Description**: "Your reservation at [Restaurant] has been confirmed for [time]. Table: [number]"
- **Chat**: Automatic message appears in chat with same info

#### 2. **Alternative Time Suggested** üí°
- **Toast**: Blue info toast
- **Title**: "üí° Alternative Time Suggested"
- **Description**: "[Restaurant] suggested [alternative time] instead"
- **Chat**: Shows the suggested time

#### 3. **Declined Reservation** ‚ùå
- **Toast**: Yellow warning toast
- **Title**: "‚ùå Reservation Declined"
- **Description**: "[Restaurant] could not accommodate your request. [reason]"
- **Chat**: Shows decline reason if provided

#### 4. **Expired Hold** ‚è∞
- **Toast**: Yellow warning toast
- **Title**: "‚è∞ Reservation Expired"
- **Description**: "Your hold at [Restaurant] has expired"

#### 5. **Cancelled Reservation** üö´
- **Toast**: Red error toast
- **Title**: "üö´ Reservation Cancelled"
- **Description**: "Your reservation at [Restaurant] was cancelled"

### How to Test with Real Restaurant:
1. The restaurant needs to publish a kind 32102 Nostr event (reservation response)
2. The event must be a NIP-59 gift wrap addressed to your public key
3. The frontend subscription will automatically detect and display it

---

## Test Scenario 3: Multiple Reservations

### Steps:
1. Send reservation to **Smoothies & Muffins**: `"Book table for 2 at Smoothies tomorrow at 3pm"`
2. Send another to different restaurant (if available): `"Reserve table for 4 at [Other Restaurant] tonight at 7pm"`

### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ Each reservation gets its own thread
- ‚úÖ Threads are sorted by most recent first
- ‚úÖ Each response shows in correct thread
- ‚úÖ No duplicate notifications

---

## Debugging Tips

### If reservation request doesn't send:
1. **Check OpenAI API Key**: `cat backend/.env | grep OPENAI_API_KEY`
2. **Check Nostr keys**: Console should show "Nostr identity initialized"
3. **Check CORS**: No CORS errors in console
4. **Check restaurant supports reservations**: Backend should log "supports_reservations: True"

### If notifications don't appear:
1. **Check ReservationContext**: Console should show "Reservation messenger ready"
2. **Check subscription**: Look for WebSocket connections to Nostr relays in Network tab
3. **Check gift wrap**: Response must be properly encrypted and addressed to you

### Console Commands for Debugging:
```javascript
// Check if Nostr keys are loaded
localStorage.getItem('nostr-keys')

// Check reservation threads (in React DevTools)
// Look for ReservationContext state

// Check processed responses
// (internal ref, not visible but prevents duplicates)
```

### Backend Debugging:
```bash
# Watch for NIP-89 discovery
tail -f /tmp/backend-new.log | grep "NIP89"

# Watch for OpenAI function calls
tail -f /tmp/backend-new.log | grep "function_call"

# Watch for reservation actions
tail -f /tmp/backend-new.log | grep "reservation_action"
```

## Known Limitations

1. **No Reservation History UI**: Threads are tracked in memory but not displayed in a dedicated UI yet
2. **No Manual Restaurant Response Tool**: You'll need a separate app to simulate restaurant responses
3. **Test Environment**: Currently using production Nostr relays (relay.damus.io, nos.lol, relay.nostr.band)

---

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ User can send reservation requests via natural language chat  
‚úÖ Backend correctly identifies restaurants that support reservations  
‚úÖ Frontend sends encrypted Nostr messages (NIP-59 gift wraps)  
‚úÖ Frontend subscription receives and decrypts responses  
‚úÖ Toast notifications appear for all response types  
‚úÖ Chat messages show reservation status  
‚úÖ No duplicate notifications  
‚úÖ No console errors  

---

## Next Steps

After manual testing:
1. Deploy to AWS staging environment
2. Set up GitHub Actions for automated deployment
3. Add reservation history/management UI
4. Add integration tests with mock Nostr relays
5. Monitor production Nostr relay performance
